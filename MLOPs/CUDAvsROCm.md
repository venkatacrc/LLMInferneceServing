## ROCm vs. CUDA – A Side‑by‑Side Comparison  

| Aspect | **CUDA** (Compute Unified Device Architecture) | **ROCm** (Radeon Open Compute) |
|--------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Origin & Vendor** | NVIDIA proprietary framework, introduced in 2006. | AMD open‑source stack, released in 2016 (initially as “AMD APP SDK”, renamed ROCm in 2017). |
| **Primary Target Hardware** | All NVIDIA GPUs (from the first Tesla/GeForce 8‑series up to the latest Hopper/Ada). | AMD GPUs based on the GCN (Graphics Core Next) and CDNA architectures (e.g., Vega, Radeon Instinct MI series, MI200, MI300, and the newer “CDNA‑3” chips). |
| **Programming Languages** | • **CUDA C/C++** (extensions to standard C/C++) <br>• **CUDA Fortran** (PGI/Intel) <br>• **Python** via Numba, CuPy, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, etc. <br>• **Other languages** (C#, Java, Rust) via third‑party bindings. | • **HIP** (Heterogeneous‑Compute Interface for Portability) – a CUDA‑like C++ dialect that can be compiled to either AMD or NVIDIA back‑ends. <br>• **OpenCL** (via the ROCm OpenCL driver). <br>• **SYCL** (via ComputeCpp, DPC++). <br>• **Python** via ROCm‑enabled libraries (e.g., PyTorch‑ROCm, TensorFlow‑ROCm, JAX‑ROCm). |
| **Compilation Toolchain** | `nvcc` (NVIDIA CUDA Compiler) → PTX → SASS (GPU ISA). | `hipcc` (wrapper around clang/hip) → HSAIL/AMDGPU ISA (via LLVM). <br>HIP can also generate CUDA PTX when you target NVIDIA GPUs, enabling “single‑source” code that runs on both vendors. |
| **Runtime / Driver Model** | NVIDIA driver + CUDA runtime library (`cudaRuntime`). | AMD driver (amdgpu kernel driver + ROCm userspace stack) + `hipRuntime`. <br>ROCm also provides the **Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA)** runtime for low‑level control. |
| **Memory Model** | Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA) + **managed memory** (`cudaMallocManaged`). <br>Explicit `cudaMemcpy`, `cudaMemcpyAsync`, peer‑to‑peer, GPUDirect RDMA. | Unified Memory under HIP (`hipMallocManaged`), explicit `hipMemcpy`, peer‑to‑peer, and **HIP‑aware** versions of RDMA. |
| **Performance Tuning Tools** | • **Nsight Compute / Nsight Systems** (profiler, kernel inspector). <br>• **CUDA‑GDB** (debugger). <br>• **nvprof**, **cuda-memcheck**, **cuBLAS/LAPACK** tuned libraries. | • **ROC‑profiler** / **ROC‑Tracer** (similar to Nsight). <br>• **rocgdb** (debugger). <br>• **Omniperf** (performance‑modeling). <br>• **rocBLAS**, **rocFFT**, **MIOpen**, **hipCUB**. |
| **Ecosystem & Libraries** | • **cuBLAS**, **cuDNN**, **cuFFT**, **cuSPARSE**, **cuSOLVER**, **NCCL** (multi‑GPU communication). <br>• Deep‑learning frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, JAX, etc., ship with native CUDA support. | • **rocBLAS**, **MIOpen** (deep‑learning), **rocFFT**, **rocSPARSE**, **rocSOLVER**. <br>• **hipCUB**, **hipRAND**, **hipFFT**. <br>• Frameworks: PyTorch‑ROCm, TensorFlow‑ROCm, JAX‑ROCm (via `jax-rocm`), ONNX‑Runtime ROCm EP. |
| **Multi‑GPU / Distributed** | **NCCL** (high‑performance collectives), **NVLink**, **NVSwitch**, **GPUDirect RDMA**. | **rccl** (RCCL – ROCm Collective Communication Library) analogous to NCCL, **Infinity Fabric** interconnect, **XGMI** for MI series. |
| **Portability Strategy** | CUDA is vendor‑locked; code must be rewritten (or wrapped) to run on AMD/Intel GPUs. | HIP is deliberately designed as a “CUDA‑to‑ROCm” translation layer: <br>• `hipify-perl`/`hipify-clang` convert CUDA source to HIP. <br>• The same HIP source can be compiled for NVIDIA (via `hipcc --amdgpu-target=nvidia`) or AMD GPUs, enabling a single code base for both. |
| **Open‑source vs. Proprietary** | The **runtime** and **driver** are closed‑source; the **CUDA Toolkit** is freely downloadable but not open‑source. | ROCm stack (driver, runtime, libraries, compiler front‑ends) is **open‑source** under the MIT/Apache licenses, hosted on GitHub. Only the low‑level firmware inside the GPU ASIC remains closed. |
| **Supported OSes** | Windows (10/11), Linux (most major distros). | Primarily Linux (Ubuntu, RHEL, CentOS, SLES, OpenSUSE). macOS support was removed in ROCm 5.0; Windows support is experimental (via WSL2). |
| **Hardware Compatibility Note** | Almost every modern NVIDIA GPU works out‑of‑the‑box, down to older Pascal/Kepler GPUs (though performance‑critical libraries may require newer architectures). | ROCm officially supports “MI” data‑center GPUs (MI50/60/100/200/210/250/300/400) and newer Radeon Instinct cards. Some consumer Radeon GPUs (e.g., RX 6000 series) have limited ROCm support (often “experimental”). |
| **Typical Use Cases** | • Deep learning research & production (CUDA‑accelerated frameworks dominate the field). <br>• HPC simulations (CFD, molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo). <br>• Real‑time graphics‑compute hybrid apps (ray tracing, DLSS). | • HPC workloads that prize an open stack (e.g., exascale projects). <br>• AMD‑centric data‑center clusters. <br>• Researchers who want to avoid vendor lock‑in and benefit from kernel‑level visibility. |
| **Learning Curve** | Very mature documentation, many tutorials, large community. <br>GPU‑specific keywords (`__global__`, `<<<>>>`, `cuLaunchKernel`). | Similar syntax via HIP, but you need to learn the translation layer and sometimes handle minor semantic differences (e.g., `hipLaunchKernelGGL`). |
| **Future Roadmap** | Continued evolution with each new NVIDIA architecture (e.g., Hopper, Ada). Planned integration with **CUDA Graphs**, **Unified Memory 2.0**, **CUDA 12+** features. | Ongoing development to support **AMD CDNA‑3**, better **HIP** compatibility, deeper integration with **LLVM 18**, and expansions of **MIOpen** and **rccl**. |

## 1. What Are They Fundamentally?

- **CUDA** is **NVIDIA’s** proprietary parallel‑computing platform. It provides a language extension, a compiler, a runtime, and a set of highly optimized libraries that map directly onto NVIDIA’s GPU microarchitecture. Because NVIDIA controls both hardware and software, they can expose low‑level features (e.g., warp‑level primitives, tensor cores) in a tightly coupled fashion.

- **ROCm** (Radeon Open Compute) is **AMD’s** response. It is **open‑source** and built on top of the **Heterogeneous System Architecture (HSA)** foundation. The flagship programming interface in ROCm is **HIP**, a CUDA‑like language that can compile to AMD’s GPU ISA via the LLVM‑based `hipcc` compiler. ROCm also ships the classic **OpenCL** stack for broader portability, though many users now prefer HIP because of its similarity to CUDA.

## 2. Why Does the Difference Matter for You?

| Scenario | CUDA Advantage | ROCm Advantage |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Deep‑learning research** | Almost every state‑of‑the‑art framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) has first‑class **CUDA** support, plus access to **cuDNN**, **TensorRT**, **NCCL**. | ROCm versions of these frameworks exist but lag behind in features and community support; however, they are sufficient for many production workloads and give you an open stack. |
| **HPC code that must run on multiple vendors** | You would need to maintain **separate code bases** or use a portability layer (e.g., Kokkos, OpenACC). | Write once in **HIP**, use `hipify` to target both AMD and NVIDIA, or fall back to **OpenCL/SYCL** for broader portability. |
| **Access to low‑level hardware features** | Direct exposure to **Tensor Cores**, **CUDA Graphs**, **Dynamic Parallelism**, **GPUDirect RDMA**, **NVLink**. | Ability to use **Wavefronts**, **Matrix Cores** (in CDNA 2/3), **XGMI**, and **Infinity Fabric**. AMD’s open driver lets you inspect and sometimes tweak scheduler policies that are hidden in the NVIDIA stack. |
| **Licensing / Legal concerns** | Closed‑source driver; you must accept NVIDIA’s EULA. | Open‑source driver and runtime; you can audit the code, modify it, and redistribute it under the same license (subject to firmware restrictions). |
| **Operating‑system flexibility** | Works well on Windows and Linux. | Best supported on Linux; Windows support is experimental (via WSL2). |
| **Future‑proofing & community** | Dominant in AI; GPU market share > 70 % in AI training; massive ecosystem. | Growing foothold in exascale supercomputers (e.g., Frontier, AMD‑backed systems). Community around HIP is expanding, especially in projects that want a vendor‑neutral stack. |

## 3. A Minimal “Hello, World” Example in Both APIs

```cpp
// ---------- CUDA (C++) ----------
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void hello()
{
    printf("Hello from CUDA thread %d\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main()
{
    hello<<<1, 4>>>();
    cudaDeviceSynchronize();
    return 0;
}
```

```cpp
// ---------- HIP (C++) ----------
#include <hip/hip_runtime.h>
#include <stdio.h>

__global__ void hello()
{
    printf("Hello from HIP thread %d\n", threadIdx.x);
}

int main()
{
    hipLaunchKernelGGL(hello, dim3(1), dim3(4), 0, 0);
    hipDeviceSynchronize();
    return 0;
}
```

*Key observations*  

- The **syntax** is almost identical.  
- The **launch syntax** differs (`<<<>>>` vs `hipLaunchKernelGGL`).  
- Compiling with `nvcc` produces a binary for NVIDIA; compiling with `hipcc` targets AMD (or, with the `--amdgpu-target=nvidia` flag, it can generate CUDA PTX).  

---

## 4. Portability Workflow Using HIP

1. **Write code in HIP** (or write CUDA code and run it through `hipify-perl`/`hipify-clang`).  
2. **Select target at compile time**:  
   ```bash
   # For AMD GPUs
   hipcc -amdgpu-target=gfx1100 my_program.cpp -o my_program_amd

   # For NVIDIA GPUs (HIP on NVIDIA)
   hipcc --amdgpu-target=nvidia my_program.cpp -o my_program_nvidia
   ```
3. **Link against the appropriate runtime** (`hipRuntime` for AMD, `cuda` runtime for NVIDIA).  
4. **Run** – the same executable works on both hardware (provided the driver for the respective GPU is installed).

> **Tip:** Keep the computational kernels free of vendor‑specific intrinsics (e.g., `__shfl_sync` in CUDA) unless you gate them behind `#if defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__)` / `#if defined(__HIP_PLATFORM_NVIDIA__)`.

## 5. Performance Considerations

| Aspect | CUDA | ROCm |
|--------|------|------|
| **Kernel launch overhead** | Very low; mature launch path. | Comparable; some early versions had slightly higher latency, but recent ROCm releases have closed the gap. |
| **Memory bandwidth** | Up to >1 TB/s on Hopper/Ada GPUs (HBM3). | Up to ~1.6 TB/s on CDNA‑3 (MI300) HBM3. |
| **Specialized Math Units** | **Tensor Cores** (mixed‑precision FP16/BF16/TF32/FP8). | **Matrix Cores** (CDNA 2/3) support FP16/BF16/FP8. Performance per watt is similar on comparable silicon. |
| **Collective Communication** | NCCL is heavily optimized; multi‑node scaling proven at >100 TB/s on NVIDIA DGX clusters. | RCCL (rccl) is functional; performance is catching up, especially when combined with AMD’s **Infinity Fabric** for intra‑node bandwidth. |
| **Compiler Optimizations** | `nvcc`+PTX → GPU ISA; deep integration with NVIDIA’s microarchitecture. | `hipcc` uses LLVM; benefits from LLVM’s generic optimizations and upstream contributions (e.g., MLIR).|
| **Library Maturity** | cuBLAS, cuDNN, cuFFT, cusparse are industry‑standard; often 1‑2 generations ahead of analogues. | rocBLAS, MIOpen are still catching up but have closed most gaps for common workloads (e.g., conv2d performance within 5‑10 % of cuDNN on comparable hardware). |

**Bottom line:** For raw throughput on the latest NVIDIA hardware, CUDA still holds a modest edge due to years of optimization. On AMD hardware, ROCm is the *native* stack and delivers the best performance; HIP‑generated code can be competitive with CUDA‑generated code on the *same* AMD GPU.

## 6. How to Choose for a New Project

| Decision Factor | Choose CUDA if… | Choose ROCm if… |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Primary GPU vendor** | You’ll run exclusively on NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., you already own an A100 cluster). | Your target platform is AMD GPUs (e.g., MI250X in an HPC center, or you want to use consumer Radeon GPUs that are ROCm‑compatible). |
| **Vendor lock‑in tolerance** | Acceptable; you value the mature ecosystem and best‑in‑class performance. | You need an open‑source stack, or you must satisfy licensing constraints that forbid proprietary drivers. |
| **Cross‑platform reuse** | You’ll accept maintaining two code bases, or you’ll use a higher‑level abstraction (Kokkos, SYCL). | You want a single source code that can compile for both AMD and NVIDIA via HIP. |
| **Operating system** | Windows support is needed. | Your workload lives on Linux (most HPC, AI research clusters). |
| **Long‑term maintainability** | You rely on NVIDIA’s roadmap and continuous driver updates. | You want the ability to patch the driver/runtime yourself if a critical bug appears. |
| **Community & Training** | Larger pool of tutorials, StackOverflow answers, university courses. | Growing community, especially among exascale supercomputing groups and open‑source advocates. |

## 7. Frequently Asked “Edge‑Case” Questions

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| **Can I run CUDA code on an AMD GPU without rewriting it?** | Not directly. You would need a translation layer (e.g., **HIPIFY** → HIP → compile for AMD) or a higher‑level abstraction (Kokkos, OpenMP‑target, SYCL). |
| **Is ROCT‑SMI analogous to `nvidia‑smi`?** | Yes. `rocm-smi` (or `rocm-smi -i`) provides GPU temperature, utilization, power, and clock information. |
| **Do AMD GPUs support Unified Memory the same way NVIDIA does?** | HIP offers `hipMallocManaged`, but the underlying implementation is different. Unified Memory on AMD historically had higher latency; recent CDNA chips have reduced the gap, but performance‑critical code still prefers explicit `hipMemcpy`. |
| **What about tensor‑core‑like acceleration for FP8?** | AMD’s **Matrix Cores** (in CDNA‑2/3) support FP8, BF16, and INT8. MIOpen exposes these via the `miopenConvolution` API. |
| **Is there an AMD equivalent of CUDA Graphs?** | ROCm provides **hipGraph** APIs that mirror CUDA Graphs, allowing capture and replay of a series of kernels and memcopies. |
| **Can I use DirectX/Vulkan interop with ROCm?** | Yes, via **ROCm‑Vulkan Interop** and **DX12‑HIP Interop** extensions, though the ecosystem is less mature than NVIDIA’s CUDA‑Graphics interop. |
| **What’s the status of “ROCm on Windows”?** | Official support was dropped after ROCm 5.0. Community projects exist (e.g., via **WSL2** + ROCm‑Linux), but performance is not guaranteed. |
| **Are there any commercial‑grade ROCm‑based AI accelerators?** | AMD’s **MI300** (data‑center GPU) is marketed for AI/ML workloads; several hyperscalers (e.g., Meta) have deployed clusters built around MI300 and ROCm. |
